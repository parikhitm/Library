# Library Project

## Description
This is a simple library management system created as a practice project for learning JavaScript. It allows users to add books to a virtual library, display them, mark them as read or unread, and remove them from the library.

## Features
- Add new books with title, author, number of pages, and read status
- Display all books in the library
- Toggle the read status of each book
- Remove books from the library

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works
1. Books are stored as objects in an array called `myLibrary`
2. The `Book` constructor is used to create new book objects
3. The `addBookToLibrary` function adds new books to the `myLibrary` array
4. The `displayBooks` function renders the books on the web page
5. Event listeners are used to handle user interactions like adding a new book, toggling read status, and removing books

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I practiced:
- Working with objects and object constructors in JavaScript
- Manipulating the DOM
- Handling user events
- Using array methods
- Implementing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

## Future Improvements
- Add local storage to persist the library data
- Implement form validation for adding new books
- Add sorting and filtering options for the book list
- Improve the UI/UX design

## Acknowledgements
This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course.
